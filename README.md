# sectionizr
jQuery plugin for presenting UI in sections, one section at a time, each section being full width and full height, arranged horizontally or vertically. [See example](https://de-paule.github.io/sectionizr/) to appreciate its simplicity and beauty.

Sectionizr helps you present a rather bulky UI in a more friendly way, giving room for enough space for viewer comfort, and allowing them focus on what's important - overall, you can use sectionizr to break your UI into linked sections
